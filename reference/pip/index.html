<p>A module to package python projects via <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/">pip</a>.</p>
<p>Under the hood, it uses <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/dream2nix/tree/main/pkgs/fetchPipMetadata">./pkgs/fetchPipMetadata</a> to
run <code>pip install --dry-run --report [...]</code> with reproducible inputs and converts the resulting installation report into a dream2nix
lock file.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Due to limitations in <code>pip</code>s cross-platform support, the resulting
lock-files are platform-specific!
We therefore recommend setting <code>paths.lockFile</code> to <code>lock.${system}.json</code>
for all projects where you use the pip module.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="../WIP-python-pdm/index.md">pdm module</a> if you need a solution that
allows locking for multiple platforms at once!</p>
</div>
<p>During building, it uses this lock file to build each dependency as well as the top-level package in separate derivations
while allowing overrides and further customization via <a href="../../modules.md">dream2nix module system</a>.</p>

<p>All dependencies of the package. This option should be set by the "outer world" and can be used to inherit attributes from <code>pkgs</code> or <code>inputs</code> etc.</p>
<p>By separating the task of retrieving things from the outside world, it is ensured that the dependencies are overridable.
Nothing will stop users from adding <code>nixpkgs</code> itself as a dependency, but this will make it very hard for the user of the package to override any dependencies, because they'd have to figure out a way to insert their changes into the Nixpkgs fixpoint. By adding specific attributes to <code>deps</code> instead, the user has a realistic chance of overriding those dependencies.</p>
<p>So deps should be specific, but not overly specific. For instance, the caller shouldn't have to know the version of a dependency in order to override it. The name should suffice. (e.g. <code>nix = nixVersions.nix_2_12</code> instead of <code>inherit (nixVersions) nix_2_12</code>.</p>

<p>All dependencies of the package. This option should be set by the "outer world" and can be used to inherit attributes from <code>pkgs</code> or <code>inputs</code> etc.</p>
<p>By separating the task of retrieving things from the outside world, it is ensured that the dependencies are overridable.
Nothing will stop users from adding <code>nixpkgs</code> itself as a dependency, but this will make it very hard for the user of the package to override any dependencies, because they'd have to figure out a way to insert their changes into the Nixpkgs fixpoint. By adding specific attributes to <code>deps</code> instead, the user has a realistic chance of overriding those dependencies.</p>
<p>So deps should be specific, but not overly specific. For instance, the caller shouldn't have to know the version of a dependency in order to override it. The name should suffice. (e.g. <code>nix = nixVersions.nix_2_12</code> instead of <code>inherit (nixVersions) nix_2_12</code>.</p>

<p>Whether the pyproject format should be used. When set to <code>true</code>,
<code>pypaBuildHook</code> will be used, and you can add the required build dependencies
from <code>build-system.requires</code> to <code>build-system</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the pyproject format falls back to using <code>setuptools</code>, so
you can use <code>pyproject = true</code> even if the package only has a <code>setup.py</code>.
When set to <code>false</code>, you can use the existing hooks or provide your own
logic to build the package. This can be useful for packages that don't
support the pyproject format.</p>
<p>When unset, the legacy <code>setuptools</code> hooks are used for backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>All dependencies of the package. This option should be set by the "outer world" and can be used to inherit attributes from <code>pkgs</code> or <code>inputs</code> etc.</p>
<p>By separating the task of retrieving things from the outside world, it is ensured that the dependencies are overridable.
Nothing will stop users from adding <code>nixpkgs</code> itself as a dependency, but this will make it very hard for the user of the package to override any dependencies, because they'd have to figure out a way to insert their changes into the Nixpkgs fixpoint. By adding specific attributes to <code>deps</code> instead, the user has a realistic chance of overriding those dependencies.</p>
<p>So deps should be specific, but not overly specific. For instance, the caller shouldn't have to know the version of a dependency in order to override it. The name should suffice. (e.g. <code>nix = nixVersions.nix_2_12</code> instead of <code>inherit (nixVersions) nix_2_12</code>.</p>

<p>Remove bytecode from bin folder.
When a Python script has the extension <code>.py</code>, bytecode is generated
Typically, executables in bin have no extension, so no bytecode is generated.
However, some packages do provide executables with extensions, and thus bytecode is generated.</p>

<p>All dependencies of the package. This option should be set by the "outer world" and can be used to inherit attributes from <code>pkgs</code> or <code>inputs</code> etc.</p>
<p>By separating the task of retrieving things from the outside world, it is ensured that the dependencies are overridable.
Nothing will stop users from adding <code>nixpkgs</code> itself as a dependency, but this will make it very hard for the user of the package to override any dependencies, because they'd have to figure out a way to insert their changes into the Nixpkgs fixpoint. By adding specific attributes to <code>deps</code> instead, the user has a realistic chance of overriding those dependencies.</p>
<p>So deps should be specific, but not overly specific. For instance, the caller shouldn't have to know the version of a dependency in order to override it. The name should suffice. (e.g. <code>nix = nixVersions.nix_2_12</code> instead of <code>inherit (nixVersions) nix_2_12</code>.</p>
